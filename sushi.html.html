			<h3>Introduction</h3>
			<p>Sushi is a Japanese dish of specially prepared vinegared rice, usually with some sugar and salt, combined with a variety of ingredients, such as seafood (most commonly and often raw), vegetables, and occasionally tropical fruits. Styles of sushi and its presentation vary widely, but the key ingredient is "sushi rice", also referred to as shari, or sumeshi. The term sushi is no longer used in its original context and literally means "sour-tasting"</p>	 	
			<p>Sushi can be prepared with brown rice, but traditionally it is made with medium grain white rice. It is often prepared with raw seafood, but some varieties of sushi use cooked ingredients such as calamari, eel, and imitation crab meat. Many others are vegetarian. Sushi is often served with pickled ginger, wasabi, and soy sauce. Daikon radish is popular as a garnish.</p>
			<p>Sushi is sometimes confused with sashimi, a related Japanese dish consisting of thinly sliced raw fish, or occasionally meat, and an optional serving of rice.</p>

			<h3>History</h3>
			<p>Sushi originates in a Southeast Asian dish, known today as narezushi, stored in fermented rice for possibly months at a time. The lacto-fermentation of the rice prevented the fish from spoiling, the rice would be discarded before consumption of the fish.This early type of sushi became an important source of protein for its Japanese consumers. The term sushi comes from an antiquated grammatical form no longer used in other contexts, and literally means "sour-tasting", the overall dish has a sour and umami or savoury taste.Narezushi still exists as a regional specialty, notably as funa-zushi from Shiga Prefecture</p>
			<p>Vinegar began to be added to the preparation of narezushi in the Muromachi period (1336 to 1573) for the sake of enhancing both taste and preservation. In addition to increasing the rice's sourness, the vinegar significantly increased the dish's longevity, causing the fermentation process to be shortened and eventually abandoned. The primitive sushi would be furthered developed in Osaka, where over several centuries it became oshi-zushi; in this preparation, the seafood and rice were pressed into shape with wooden (typically bamboo) mold</p>
			<p>It was not until the Edo period (1603-1868) that fresh fish was served over vinegared rice. The particular style of today's nigirizushi became popular in Edo (contemporary Tokyo) in the 1820s or 1830s. One common story of nigirizushi's origins is of the chef Hanaya Yohei (1799-1858), who invented or perfected the technique in 1824 at his shop in Ryogoku.The dish was originally termed Edomae zushi as it used freshly caught fish from the Edo-mae (Edo or Tokyo Bay); the term Edomae nigirizushi is still used today as a by-word for quality sushi, regardless of its ingredients</p>

			<h3>Condiments</h3> 
			<p>Sushi is commonly eaten with condiments. Sushi may be dipped in shoyu, soy sauce, and is usually flavored with wasabi, a piquant paste made from the grated stem of the Wasabia japonica plant. Japanese-style mayonnaise is a common condiment in Japan on salmon, pork and other sushi cuts.</p>
			<p>True wasabi has anti-microbial properties and may reduce the risk of food poisoning.The traditional grating tool for wasabi is a sharkskin grater or samegawa oroshi. An imitation wasabi (seiyo-wasabi), made from horseradish, mustard powder and green dye is common. It is found at lower-end kaiten-zushi restaurants, in bento box sushi and at most restaurants outside Japan. If manufactured in Japan, it may be labelled "Japanese Horseradish".</p>
			<p>Gari (sweet, pickled ginger) is eaten in between sushi courses to both cleanse the palate and aid in digestion. In Japan, green tea (ocha) is invariably served together with sushi. Better sushi restaurants often use a distinctive premium tea known as mecha. In sushi vocabulary, green tea is known as agari.</p>
			<p>Sushi may be garnished with gobo, grated daikon, thinly sliced vegetables, carrots/radishes/cucumbers that have been shaped to look like flowers, real flowers, or seaweed salad.</p>

			<h3>Nutrition<h3>
			<p>The main ingredients of traditional Japanese sushi, raw fish and rice, are naturally low in fat, high in protein, carbohydrates (the rice only), vitamins, and minerals, as are gari and nori. Other vegetables wrapped within the sushi also offer various vitamins and minerals. Many of the seafood ingredients also contain omega-3 fatty acids, which have a variety of health benefits.The omega-3 fatty acids found in fish has certain beneficial property, especially on cardiovascular health, natural anti-inflammatory compounds, and play a role in brain function.</p>
			<p>Generally sushi is not a particularly fattening food. However, rice in sushi contains a fair amount of carbohydrates, plus the addition of other ingredients such as mayonnaise added into sushi rolls might increase the caloric content.Sushi also has a relatively high sodium content, especially contributed from shoyu soy sauce seasoning.</p>

	<p>Oshizushi is a pressed sushi from the Kansai region, a favorite and specialty of Osaka. A block-shaped piece is formed using a wooden mold, called an oshibako. The chef lines the bottom of the oshibako with the toppings, covers them with sushi rice, and then presses the lid of the mold down to create a compact block.</p>

	<p>Whatâ€™s a sushi roll but a miniature open-ended burrito? The rice stays the rice. But the pork becomes the salmon, and the salsa becomes soy sauce. First grade math tests are less complex.The sushi burrito has been popularized over the last few years, thanks to a series of boho fast-casual chefs trying to do something fun and convenient for white collar workers and the blissfully hip.</p>
